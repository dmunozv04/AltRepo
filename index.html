You'll get this warning \"**Google couldn't confirm this attempt to sign in is safe. If you think this is a mistake, you can close and try again to sign in.**\". Please understand that it's completely different from the previous issue (https://github.com/qnblackcat/uYouPlus/issues/319).\r\n- Some accounts are not affected by this problem and can be signed in without a problem. We still don't know why though. No **real** solution has been confirmed yet. You can discuss about the issue here: https://github.com/qnblackcat/uYouPlus/discussions/428\r\n- With the release of [**TrollStore**](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), I **highly recommend** you use [**TrollStore**](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore) to install uYouPlus. Why?\r\n  - Working Push notifications.\r\n  - Working Deep link (aka Open in YouTube app).\r\n  - YTUHD will use hardware VP9 just like the official YouTube from AppStore, which means no more stuttering, heat, battery drain...\r\n  - Fixed error 200 when downloading media with uYou.\r\n  - No need to refresh the app after 7 days. \r\n  - Completely free.\r\n\r\n## Changelog:\r\n- YouTube v17.35.3.\r\n- Return YouTube Dislike v1.6.7: Fixed the app crashes when opening videos (#415), thanks to @PoomSmart <3\r\n- uYouPlus:\r\n  - Added an option to fix Google Signin (TrollStore user only).\r\n  - Added an option to replace the Previous & Next button with Fast foward & Rewind button.\r\n  - Shorts: Fixed the Shorts description shows up when you tap the like button. \r\n  - You can now swipe right to dismiss the right panel when in full screen mode.\r\n\r\n## Attention:\r\n- Workaround for missing the video's timestamp in Watch History/Playlist: Go to uYou's settings > Other Settings and [Disable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52943116/150642296-5de53fc7-a1ea-4b3d-96f4-25c9ca8b8f81.JPG) \"Remove YouTube Ads\"\r\n- YTUHD is not stable atm. You might encounter stuttering, heat, battery drain..., especially when playing at 2160p (4K) quality.\r\n- It's impossible to fix deep-link (aka Open in the YouTube App). Luckily, there are several workarounds [here](https://github.com/qnblackcat/uYouPlus/wiki/FAQ#q-deep-link-aka-open-in-the-youtube-app-doesnt-work).\r\n\r\n## Support the developers:\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>MiRO92</summary>\r\n  \r\n- https://github.com/MiRO92/uYou-for-YouTube#support\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Poomsmart</summary>\r\n\r\n- Paypal: https://poomsmart.github.io/\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Bandar Alruwaili (BandarHL)</summary>\r\n\r\n- Paypal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/BandarHL\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Galactic-dev</summary>\r\n  \r\n- Paypal: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/DBrett684 \r\n- Venmo: https://venmo.com/u/DavidBrett\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Version info:\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Expand:</summary>\r\n\r\n| **Tweaks/App** | **Developer** | **Version** | **Open source** |\r\n | - | - | :-: | :-:  |\r\n | **YouTube** | Google Inc | 17.35.3 | ✖︎ |\r\n | [uYou](https://github.com/MiRO92/uYou-for-YouTube) | [MiRO92](https://twitter.com/miro92) | 2.1 | ✖︎ |\r\n | [Open in YouTube](https://github.com/CokePokes/YoutubeExtensions) | [CokePokes](https://github.com/CokePokes) | 1.2 | ✖︎ |\r\n | **iSponsorBlock** | [Galactic-Dev](https://github.com/Galactic-Dev) | 1.0-15 | [✔︎](https://github.com/Galactic-Dev/iSponsorBlock) |\r\n | **BigYTMiniPlayer** | [Galactic-Dev](https://github.com/Galactic-Dev) | 1.0-1 | [✔︎](https://github.com/Galactic-Dev/BigYTMiniPlayer) |\r\n | **YTNoHoverCards** | [level3tjg](https://twitter.com/level3tjg) | 0.0.3 | [✔︎](https://github.com/level3tjg/YTNoHoverCards) |\r\n | **YTMiniplayerEnabler** | [level3tjg](https://twitter.com/level3tjg) | 0.0.2 | [✔︎](https://github.com/level3tjg/YTMiniplayerEnabler) |\r\n | **YTSpeed** | [Lyvendia](https://github.com/Lyvendia) | 1.0.1 | [✔︎](https://github.com/Lyvendia/YTSpeed) |\r\n | **YTCastConfirm** | [JamieBerghmans](https://github.com/JamieBerghmans) | 1.0.0 | [✔︎](https://github.com/JamieBerghmans/YTCastConfirm) |\r\n | **Alderis Color Picker** | [HASHBANG Productions](https://github.com/hbang) | 1.2| [✔︎](https://github.com/hbang/Alderis) |\r\n | **YTUHD** | [PoomSmart](https://twitter.com/poomsmart) | 1.2.9 | [✔︎](https://github.com/PoomSmart/YTUHD) |\r\n | **YouPiP** | [PoomSmart](https://twitter.com/poomsmart) | 1.7.7 | [✔︎](https://github.com/PoomSmart/YouPiP) |\r\n | **IAmYouTube** | [PoomSmart](https://twitter.com/poomsmart) | 1.2.0 | [✔︎](https://github.com/PoomSmart/IAmYouTube) |\r\n | **YTReExplore** | [PoomSmart](https://twitter.com/poomsmart) | 1.0.2 | [✔︎](https://github.com/PoomSmart/YTReExplore) |\r\n | **NoYTPremium** | [PoomSmart](https://twitter.com/poomsmart) | 1.0.4 | [✔︎](https://github.com/PoomSmart/NoYTPremium) |\r\n | **YTNoPaidPromo** | [PoomSmart](https://twitter.com/poomsmart) | 1.0.0 | [✔︎](https://github.com/PoomSmart/YTNoPaidPromo) |\r\n | **YTAutoFullScreen** | [PoomSmart](https://twitter.com/poomsmart) | 1.0.3 | [✔︎](https://github.com/PoomSmart/YTAutoFullScreen) |\r\n | **YouRememberCaption** | [PoomSmart](https://twitter.com/poomsmart) | 1.0.0 | [✔︎](https://poomsmart.github.io/repo/depictions/youremembercaption.html) |\r\n | **YTSystemAppearance** | [PoomSmart](https://twitter.com/poomsmart) | 1.0.0 | [✔︎](https://poomsmart.github.io/repo/depictions/ytsystemappearance.html) |\r\n | **YTClassicVideoQuality** | [PoomSmart](https://twitter.com/poomsmart) | 1.0.1 | [✔︎](https://github.com/PoomSmart/YTClassicVideoQuality) |\r\n | **Return YouTube Dislike** | [PoomSmart](https://twitter.com/poomsmart) | 1.6.7 | [✔︎](https://github.com/PoomSmart/Return-YouTube-Dislikes) |\r\n | **YTNoCheckLocalNetwork** | [PoomSmart](https://twitter.com/poomsmart) | 1.0.2 | [✔︎](https://poomsmart.github.io/repo/depictions/ytnochecklocalnetwork.html) |\r\n\r\n</details>","downloadURL":"https://github.com/qnblackcat/uYouPlus/releases/download/v17.35.3-2.1/uYouPlus_17.35.3_2.1.ipa","size":126325589}],"news":[]}
